# MobileDeviceTrackingSystem

Keep track of device specifics (e.g. Sn., IMEI) disposition (In service, not in service, defective) and who those devices are assigned to.

Learning how to do this in C#

Using Microsoft Access for the back-end database. Will move to SQL after the table relationships & normalizations are tested.
